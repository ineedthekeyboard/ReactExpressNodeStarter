## Full Stack React

This project implements a basic full stack project with database connections templated for users as well as a full react front end showing the basics of login, registration, and user data retrival. With minor changes it can be adapted to Vue js or a full server side rendered website. 

This Project also contains a full express/mongo backend. Mongodb is expect to be running locally, or a url is to be passed into the env var. See config for details.
